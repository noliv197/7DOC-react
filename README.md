* 7 Days Of Code Challenge
  * The challenge proposes to follow simple guidelines given over the course of 7 days to create a Front-End App. 
 
* The main focus of this project was to practice how to:
  * Create components with React;
  * Use CSS-in-JS;
  * Manipulate data;
  * Use React Hooks;

- Schedule
  - Day 1: Create menu and newsletter components
  - Day 2: Use styled components for styling
  - Day 3: Form validation and alert message
  - Day 4: Send register confirmation to the email provided
  - Day 5: Connect application to a server to get products list
  - Day 6: Create filter and sort buttons
  - Day 7: Deploy the application

- Observations:
    - The project was build with create-react-app
    - I created the function to send the email, but since the backend was not implemented it is not working
    - I used Supabase as the data server API
